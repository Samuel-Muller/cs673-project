## Vision
Our billing and revenue management system allows for claims to be sent out either in house by a practice or through a third party billing company. These bills are sent out to payers and the status can be checked through a convenient interface to see if the payer has completed the payment. Payments can be made through cash as well as insurance, and insurance eligibility can be checked and stored through a patientâ€™s EHR. Our billing and revenue system also allows for easy ICD-10 lookup for specifying patient conditions.
