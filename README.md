## Vision
Our billing and revenue management system allows for claims to be sent out either in house by a practice or through a third party billing company. These bills are sent out to payers and the status can be checked through a convenient interface to see if the payer has completed the payment. Payments can be made through cash as well as insurance, and insurance eligibility can be checked and stored through a patientâ€™s EHR. Our billing and revenue system also allows for easy ICD-10 lookup for specifying patient conditions.

## Stakeholders
* Payer (patient)
* Practice
* 3rd party billing company
* Insurance company

## User Personas
James, age 27, is the payer for his recent treatment from Local Medical Center and wants to pay part of his outstanding balance for the treatment. He prefers to pay through the online portal where he can pay by credit card through his account. He can access the online payment portal and see his remaining balance and due date after making his latest payment.  
Steven, age 60, is a physician at Local Medical Center who has been practicing medicine for 30 years. He is not very tech savvy and prefers to do paperwork physically or on very easy to use systems. The local medical center has had a buildup of paperwork recently, especially with billing related invoices, due to staffing shortages.
